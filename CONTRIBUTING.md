## Style Guidelines

### Go Style Guide

* Follow the official [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
* Run `go fmt` before committing
* Run `go vet` to catch common mistakes
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add comments for exported functions and types
* Keep functions small and focused

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
